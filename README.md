# Simulation of queuing algorithm in PyQt6
Simulation of queuing clients who want to upload files to online drives.

It was the final project of the "concurrent programming" classes.
The task was to figure out a queue algorithm and then implement it's simulation.
I decided to make a simulation using PyQt due to my experience with this framework.
